# ps_ActorBase

This Godot plugin provides handling for creating actors based on components.

**Tested Godot version:** 3.3

**Info:** This repository is in maintenance mode. I do not work actively on it, but if you create issues or Pull Requests, I will take a look. Time-wise that might vary though.

## HowTo

Please check out the examples folder on how to use this plugin.

## Why

I tend to create over and over again the configurations for animations, inputs and physics mostly the same way in multiple projects. To not have to copy&paste this code from project to project, this is a simple dropin of that code.
